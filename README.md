## commands

## messages
Whatever the bot says. Supports expandable variables (eg. `%nick%` for bot's nick). By default all config vars from `rpc` section are available.

# How does it work?
Every nickname has it's own account in your wallet. When tipping or withdrawing, bot checks if user is registered and identified with NickServ. If so, he moves the money from one account to another, or when withdrawing, transfers coins to other wallet.

# How to run it?
Before running the bot, you have to be running your coin daemon with JSON-RPC API enabled. To enable, add this to your coin daemon configuration file (eg. `~/.dogecoin/dogecoin.conf`):
```ini
server=1
daemon=1
rpcuser=<your username>
rpcpassword=<your super secret password>
rpcallowip=<your bot's ip address or just 127.0.0.1 if hosted on the same machine>
```

To run the bot simply use `node bin/tipbot` or `npm start`.

## Commands
Commands are executed by messaging the bot. Commands that have channel:true in the config can be run with '!<command>' in the channel.

| **Command** | **Arguments**     | **Description**
|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
| `balance`   |                   | displays your current wallet balance
| `address`   |                   | displays address where you can send your funds to the tip bot
| `withdraw`  | `<address>`       | withdraws your whole wallet balance to specified address
| `tip`       | `<nick> <amount>` | sends the specified amount of coins to the specified nickname
| `help`      |                   | displays configured help message (by default similiar to this one)
